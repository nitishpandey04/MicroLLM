# initialize the dataloader
# initialize the model
# initialize the training
# resume training from checkpoint
# run evaluation


"""
the training will be started from here using the trainer
we don't have to initialize the dataloader here, directly do it in trainer
just initialize the trainer object and start the training from this file or give cli access
this file can also be called from a bash script (like in nanochat repo)
